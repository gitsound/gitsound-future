# gitsound-future

WIP, doesn't even use git yet

![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/gitsound/gitsound-future.svg?branch=master)

Install:
```sh
yarn
```

You'll need to set the `.env` file

(you'll probably want to run `git update-index --skip-worktree .env` after so you don't commit it)

Run:
```
yarn start
```

Lint:
```
yarn lint
```
